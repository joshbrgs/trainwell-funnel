# MongoDB Connection Fix

## The Problem

You were getting this error:
```
/Users/josh/projects/trainwell-funnel/server/src/lib/mongo-client.ts:45
      throw new Error('Database not connected. Call connect() first.');
```

## Root Cause

The issue was a **timing/initialization order problem**:

```
1. Routes are loaded (app.ts imports routes)
   ‚Üì
2. Controllers are instantiated (routes import controllers)
   ‚Üì
3. Services are instantiated (controllers create services)
   ‚Üì
4. Repositories are instantiated (services create repositories)
   ‚Üì
5. Repository constructor calls mongoClient.getDb() ‚ùå
   ‚Üì
6. ERROR: Database not connected yet!
   ‚Üì
7. server.ts finally calls mongoClient.connect() (too late!)
```

The repository was trying to access the database **in its constructor**, but the database connection wasn't established until **after** all the routes/controllers/services/repositories were already created.

## The Solution

Changed from **eager initialization** to **lazy loading** in the repository.

### Before (Broken)
```typescript
export class EventRepository {
  private collection: Collection<EventDocument>;

  constructor() {
    // ‚ùå Called immediately when repository is created (before DB connected)
    const db = mongoClient.getDb();
    this.collection = db.collection<EventDocument>('events');
  }

  async findById(id: string): Promise<EventDocument | null> {
    return await this.collection.findOne({ _id: new ObjectId(id) });
  }
}
```

### After (Fixed)
```typescript
export class EventRepository {
  /**
   * Get the events collection
   * Lazy-loads the collection to avoid connection issues during initialization
   */
  private getCollection(): Collection<EventDocument> {
    // ‚úÖ Called only when needed (after DB is connected)
    const db = mongoClient.getDb();
    return db.collection<EventDocument>('events');
  }

  async findById(id: string): Promise<EventDocument | null> {
    return await this.getCollection().findOne({ _id: new ObjectId(id) });
  }
}
```

## Why This Works

**Lazy Loading** means we don't access the database until we actually need it:

```
1. Routes are loaded
   ‚Üì
2. Controllers are instantiated
   ‚Üì
3. Services are instantiated
   ‚Üì
4. Repositories are instantiated ‚úÖ (no DB access yet)
   ‚Üì
5. server.ts calls mongoClient.connect() ‚úÖ
   ‚Üì
6. User makes HTTP request
   ‚Üì
7. Repository.findById() is called
   ‚Üì
8. getCollection() is called (DB is now connected!) ‚úÖ
   ‚Üì
9. Success! üéâ
```

## Changes Made

**File:** `server/src/repositories/event.repository.ts`

1. Removed the `collection` property
2. Added `getCollection()` method that returns the collection
3. Updated all methods to call `this.getCollection()` instead of `this.collection`

**Modified methods:**
- `findById()` - line 29
- `findMany()` - line 56
- `count()` - line 78

## Key Takeaway

When working with database connections in a layered architecture:

‚úÖ **DO**: Use lazy loading (getter methods) for database access
‚ùå **DON'T**: Access the database in constructors

This ensures your application can initialize its layers without requiring an active database connection, and only connects when actually needed during request handling.
